**Machine Learning Model for Diabetes Dataset**

In this work, we look into which machine learning model would perform the best 
when it comes to detecting diabetes. This is built on identifying key variables 
and exploring how each variable affects one another.

Variables include No. of Patient, Sugar Level Blood, Age, Gender, Creatinine ratio(Cr), Body Mass Index (BMI), Urea, Cholesterol (Chol), Fasting lipid profile, including total, LDL, VLDL, Triglycerides(TG) and HDL Cholesterol , HBA1C, Class (the patient's diabetes disease class may be Diabetic, Non-Diabetic, or Predict-Diabetic).

Dataset source comes from Mendeley Data.
